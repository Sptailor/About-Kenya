                 <p><strong>Colonisation (1895-1963)</strong></p> 
            <p>The precolonial history of Kenya is rich and diverse, encompassing a period before European colonial powers exerted influence over the region. Kenya was home to numerous ethnic groups, each with its distinct languages, traditions, and social structures. Precolonial Kenya had diverse governance systems. Many ethnic groups were organized into chiefdoms or kingdoms, each with its own political structure and leadership.</p>
        <p>The Berlin Conference, convened to regulate European colonization in Africa, formalized the partitioning of the continent among European powers. This led to the establishment of the East African Protectorate, which included present-day Kenya.Britain sought to establish control over key trade routes and strategic locations in East Africa, including the port of Mombasa. The colonisation led to biulding of the Kenya-Uganda railway, introduction of cash crops such as coffee and spread of christianity.

                <h4><strong>Beggining of the Uprising</strong></h4>
            <p> A key part of the struggle for Kenyan independence from British colonial rule was the Mau Mau uprising whch was a significant armed conflict that took place in Kenya between 1952 and 1960. The uprising was fueled by grievances against British colonial policies, including forced labor, land dispossession, and the creation of "white highlands" for European settlers. The Mau Mau movement originated within the Kikuyu community, the largest ethnic group in Kenya. The term "Mau Mau" was initially used to describe the Land Freedom Army. The uprising officially began in 1952 with attacks on European settlers, government officials, and African collaborators. The British declared a state of emergency in response. The British colonial authorities responded with a robust counterinsurgency campaign, which included mass arrests, detentions, and the establishment of detention camps. The Mau Mau engaged in guerrilla warfare tactics, conducting hit-and-run attacks on British forces and collaborating Africans. </p>

            <h4><strong>Fall of the uprising</strong></h4>
            <p>By the late 1950s, the Mau Mau's strength had diminished, and British forces gained the upper hand. The Mau Mau Uprising contributed to changing attitudes toward colonialism. Negotiations led to constitutional changes, and Kenya gained independence on December 12, 1963. The Mau Mau Uprising is a critical part of Kenya's history, symbolizing the resistance against colonial oppression. It also led to land reforms and efforts to address historical injustices. The Mau Mau Uprising had a profound impact on Kenya's path to independence, influencing political, social, and economic changes in the post-colonial era. The struggle and sacrifices of those involved are remembered as a pivotal moment in the nation's history.</p>
